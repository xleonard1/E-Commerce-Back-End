# E-Commerce-Back-End


## Description
I was tasked with building the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I had to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In order to complete this task, I also needed to use dotenv, sequilize, express.js, and mysql.
```

I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I made sure to be able connect to a database using Sequelize
Enter schema and seed commands
Create and Seed a developer database
Start the server and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
Open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
Successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
